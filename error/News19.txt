"A new US poll has revealed that Prince Harry’s popularity has further dropped among young Americans since the release of his memoir ‘Spare’ earlier this month. According to the poll, 31 per cent of the voters said they liked him but 38 per cent of participants said they disliked him. This resulted in a decline of 7 per cent in his net approval.
The data was collected by consulting firm Redfield & Wilton for a poll for Newsweek from at least 2,000 eligible US voters on January 16, which was less than a week after the Duke of Sussex released his autobiography on January 11.
It is to note that Newsweek conducted a similar poll on December 5, 2022, prior to the release of his book, Prince Harry’s net approval was at +38 per cent. This means that ultimately, his popularity among young Americans has declined by 45 points in just a matter of a month.
But, in the latest poll, apart from an increase in people who disliked Prince Harry, other participants criticised the Duke of Sussex’s new book. 44 per cent of the voters said that ‘Spare’ left out so many details about his own private life. But, 26 per cent of Americans said that he was right about publishing the sensitive information in his memoir.Remarkably, his wife, Meghan Markle’s popularity also declined within a month. Prince Harry’s wife, Meghan’s net approval went from +23 to -13, recording a drop of 36 points. The decline in her popularity came after 26% of Americans said they favoured her while 39 per cent voted unfavourably.
This result has marked a stark change in public opinion before and after the release of Prince Harry’s autobiography ‘Spare’ in which he revealed several private details about life in the UK royal family including one time when he got into a physical altercation with his brother Prince William who is now the Prince of Wales. In ‘Spare’, Prince Harry also claimed that his father, now King Charles III used to make jokes about the Duke of Sussex’s “real father”."
