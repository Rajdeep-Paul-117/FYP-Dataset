The Congress parliamentarian from Kaliabor Gaurav Gogoi on September 27th, 2019, blamed the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the exclusion of people belonging to the Gorkha community from the final National Register of Citizens (NRC) list, which was released on August 31st, 2019.

“Mismanagement of the BJP has led to the exclusion of the Gorkha people from the final NRC list,” Gogoi said while addressing a three-hour-long sit-in demonstration by the All Assam Gorkha Students’ Union (AAGSU) in Guwahati.
He further assured the people of the community of taking necessary steps for inclusion of their names in the list. “I will continue fighting for their right to be included in NRC both in and outside the Parliament,” Gogoi said.

Dissatisfied over the exclusion of people Gorkhas from the list, the Lakhimpur wing of the AAGSU on September 24th, 2019, staged a sit-in demonstration in front of the office of the Deputy Commissioner. The protesters demanded inclusion of the Gorkha people, who are ‘bonafide Indian citizens’, in the final list.

On August 31st, 2019, the Bharatiya Gorkha Parisangha claimed that the final list excluded more than one lakh people belonging to the community. The final list included a total of 3,11,21,004 persons and excluded 19,06,657 persons including those who did not submit claims.
