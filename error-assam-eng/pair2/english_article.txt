The TMC leader added that he has always followed the path laid down in the Constitution.

"As a soldier of the party, I have always followed the path laid down by our Constitution, which calls for respecting and honoring our diversity. Anything that appears like an inadvertent digression from that path is absolutely regrettable," he further said.

Mr Azad, a former India cricketer who was a part of the country's 1983 World Cup campaign, posted a picture of PM Modi in the traditional tribal attire of Meghalaya and compared it with a women's dress.

After his remarks, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma lashed out at the TMC leader and accused him of 'disrespecting' the culture of Meghalaya and 'mocking' the state's tribal attire.
